# Port-Scanner

This code implements a simple port scanner application using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Tkinter library in Python. The application allows users to specify a target IP address, range of ports to scan, timeout duration, and protocol (UDP or TCP). It provides a start button to initiate the scan and displays the scan progress using a progress bar. The results of the scan are logged in a text view within the GUI.

Note: This code provides a basic port scanning functionality and may not be suitable for large-scale or advanced port scanning tasks. It serves as a simple demonstration of creating a port scanner application with a GUI using Tkinter.
